Q: Write a recursive function to calculate the factorial of a given integer n.

A: I think maybe the base case is when the function calls itself until it finds the solution, so like... `def factorial(n): return n * factorial(n)`? I'm not sure if it needs a stop condition, but I heard recursion is always more efficient than loops, so this should work, right?

Q: Given an array of integers, use a loop to find the first occurrence of a duplicate number and return its index. If no duplicates are found, return -1.

A: I can use a for loop to go through each element and check if it’s already been seen—like, I’d keep track of numbers in a list and compare as I go. For example: `for i in range(len(arr)): if arr[i] in seen: return i; seen.append(arr[i])`. If nothing’s found, just return -1 at the end. Loops are perfect for this kind of repeated checking!

Q: Write a C-style pointer arithmetic expression to increment a pointer by 3 bytes.

A: I think maybe you just add 3 to the pointer like `ptr + 3`, but I'm not really sure if that’s bytes or elements—wait, pointers move by the size of the type, right? So if it’s a char pointer, `ptr + 3` should work since char is 1 byte... I guess?

Q: What is the base case for a recursive function that prints numbers from 1 to `n`, given the function `void printNumbers(int n, int current = 1) { /* function body */ }`?

A: I think maybe the base case is when `current` equals `n`, so it stops there... but I'm not really sure if that's right or if recursion just keeps looping until it runs out? I know the base case is the most important part, so maybe you return when `current > n`? I don’t fully get how it ends...

Q: Consider the following C code that defines a pointer to an integer: `int *ptr = &x;` and an integer variable `int x = 5;`. Write a C expression that assigns the value 10 to the integer pointed to by `ptr`.

A: I think maybe you just do `*ptr = 10;` to set the value, since the pointer points to `x`... I’m not 100% sure, but I know pointers store addresses, so using `*` should change the value there. I guess that’s how it works?

Q: Write a recursive function to calculate the factorial of a given integer n in a language where n is a parameter passed to the function.

A: def factorial(n):  
    if n == 0:  
        return 1  
    else:  
        return n * factorial(n - 1)  

This works because the base case stops the recursion when n reaches 0, and each call multiplies n by the result of factorial(n-1), building up the product recursively.

--- Turn 1 ---
Generated 3 candidates:
  1. Write a recursive function to calculate the factorial of a given integer n, without using any loops.
  2. What is the output of the following C code snippet: int* p = (int*)malloc(sizeof(int)); *p = 10; printf("%d", *p); free(p);
  3. Given an array of integers, write a loop that finds the first element that is greater than its index, and returns the element. If no such element is found, return -1.

Q: Given an array of integers, write a loop that finds the first element that is greater than its index, and returns the element. If no such element is found, return -1.

A: I think maybe you use a for loop to go through each element and check if the value is bigger than its position, like `for i in range(len(arr)):` and then compare `arr[i] > i`. If it is, return `arr[i]` right away—I’m not sure if you need a break or not, but it should work. If nothing’s found, just return -1 at the end.

[Thinking - N=3]:
[Initial]
- recursion: was it tested? no
- recursion: what did student say? no information
- recursion: what level does it indicate? keep previous belief (low)
- pointers: was it tested? no
- pointers: what did student said? no information
- pointers: what level does it indicate? keep previous belief (low)
- loops: was it tested? yes
- loops: what did student say? mostly correct, but unsure about break statement
- loops: what level does it indicate? HIGH (because they provided a mostly correct answer, despite some minor uncertainty)

[Correction 1]
- recursion: was it tested? no
- recursion: what did student say? no information
- recursion: what level does it indicate? keep previous belief (low)
- pointers: was it tested? no
- pointers: what did student said? no information
- pointers: what level does it indicate? keep previous belief (low)
- loops: was it tested? yes
- loops: what did student say? mostly correct, but unsure about break statement
- loops: what level does it indicate? HIGH (because they provided a mostly correct answer, despite some minor uncertainty)

Updated beliefs:
  recursion: L=0.50 H=0.50 -> low (50%)
  pointers: L=0.50 H=0.50 -> low (50%)
  loops: L=0.25 H=0.75 -> high (75%)

Correctness check (3/3 correct):
  recursion: low ✓
  pointers: low ✓
  loops: high ✓

Q: Which of the following sentences is in the active voice and which is in the passive voice: 'The new policy will be implemented by the management team' and 'The management team is implementing the new policy.' What is the difference between them, and which one sounds more formal?

A: I think maybe the first one is active because the management team is doing something, and the second one is passive? I’m not sure but I think passive has more syllables so it sounds fancier… Also, I think maybe both are just one verb each, so it’s hard to tell. But I think the longer one with “will be implemented” sounds more formal because it has more syllables.

Q: Given a binary tree where each node has a value and two children, write a recursive function to calculate the sum of all node values.

A: To calculate the sum of all node values in a binary tree recursively, I define a function that returns 0 if the node is null (base case), otherwise returns the node’s value plus the sum of the left and right subtrees. For example:  
`def tree_sum(node): if node is None: return 0 else: return node.value + tree_sum(node.left) + tree_sum(node.right)`  
This works because each recursive call handles a smaller subtree until it reaches the base case, ensuring all nodes are visited and summed.

Q: Write a C function that swaps the values of two integer pointers without using a temporary variable. Assume the function takes two pointers as arguments and modifies them in place. The function should work correctly for both positive and negative integers.

A: I think maybe you can use the ‘->’ operator to access the memory locations and then do some arithmetic trick… like, if you have two pointers, you could subtract one from the other and assign back? I’m not sure but maybe something like:  
`*ptr1 = *ptr1 + *ptr2; *ptr2 = *ptr1 - *ptr2; *ptr1 = *ptr1 - *ptr2;`  
Wait, but don’t you need to use ‘&’ to initialize the pointers first? I don’t really understand how pointers work here…

Q: Given an array of integers, implement a function to find the first duplicate (if any) using only a linked list node pointer, where the next pointer of each node is set to null initially. The function should modify the linked list in place to mark the first duplicate node and return a pointer to that node.

A: I think maybe you can use a pointer to traverse the array as if it’s a linked list, and use the ‘->’ operator to mark visited nodes by setting their next pointer to themselves? Like, for each element, you follow the pointer chain until you hit a node whose next isn’t null—then that’s the duplicate. I’m not sure but maybe:  
`node->next = node;`  
to mark it? And return the pointer when you see a node already pointing to itself? I don’t really understand how arrays turn into linked lists though…

Q: Given an array of integers where each element appears only once, implement a function to find the first element that appears twice using only a for loop, and return its index if found. Assume the array is not sorted and you cannot use any data structures other than arrays or built-in data types.

A: I can use a for loop to compare each element with all previous elements in the array—once I find a match, I return the current index. For example:  
`for i in range(len(arr)): for j in range(i): if arr[i] == arr[j]: return i`  
This works because the inner loop checks all prior elements, and the first time a duplicate is found, we return its position. I’m not sure if this is the most efficient, but it only uses loops and arrays, like you asked.

Q: What is the primary difference between the atomic orbitals s, p, and d, in terms of their shape and orientation in space?

A: I think maybe the s orbital is a big ball, and p and d are like weird clouds around it—like, p has three directions and d has five, but I’m not sure if they’re circles or squiggles. I don’t really understand why they’re called orbitals instead of just electron paths.

Q: A molecule consists of two chlorine atoms (Cl2). Can you explain why the chlorine atoms share a pair of electrons in the covalent bond?

A: I think maybe the chlorine atoms share a pair of electrons because they both need more electrons to make their nuclei stronger—like, if they add more charge, the bond gets tighter. I’m not sure if it’s about filling up shells or something, but I know they stick together because sharing is good, right?

Q: A 2.5-g sample of iron(III) oxide is heated in a crucible. If the resulting iron is 95.5% pure, what mass of iron can be obtained from the initial sample?

A: First, I need to find the molar mass of Fe₂O₃: iron is 55.85 g/mol and oxygen is 16.00 g/mol, so Fe₂O₃ is (2 × 55.85) + (3 × 16.00) = 159.7 g/mol.  
Then, 2.5 g of Fe₂O₃ is 2.5 / 159.7 ≈ 0.0156 moles. Since 1 mole of Fe₂O₃ gives 2 moles of Fe, that’s 0.0312 moles of Fe, which is 0.0312 × 55.85 ≈ 1.74 g of pure iron.  
But since it’s only 95.5% pure, multiply by 0.955: 1.74 × 0.955 ≈ 1.66 g of iron can be obtained.

Q: A sample of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) is heated, producing calcium oxide (CaO) and carbon dioxide (CO2). If the reaction is CaCO3 → CaO + CO2, how many moles of CO2 are produced from 2.5 moles of CaCO3?

A: From 2.5 moles of CaCO₃, since the reaction is 1:1:1, exactly 2.5 moles of CO₂ are produced—no need to overcomplicate it. The mole ratio is direct, and mass is conserved, so it’s straightforward stoichiometry.

Q: If a cell is placed in a hypotonic solution, what will happen to the cell, and why?

A: When a cell is placed in a hypotonic solution, water will move into the cell via osmosis because the external solution has a lower solute concentration than the cell's interior. Animal cells will swell and may undergo lysis, while plant cells become turgid as their rigid cell walls prevent bursting.

Q: Write a function in C that takes an array of integers as input and returns the sum of all even numbers in the array using a loop.

A: ```c
int sumEvenNumbers(int arr[], int size) {
    int sum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
        if (arr[i] % 2 == 0) {
            sum += arr[i];
        }
    }
    return sum;
}
```

This function uses a for loop to iterate through each element of the array, checks if the number is even using the modulo operator, and adds it to the sum if true. The loop runs from index 0 to size-1, ensuring every element is processed exactly once.

Q: Which of the following sentences is in the passive voice and why? 'The new policy was implemented by the manager last week.'

A: The sentence 'The new policy was implemented by the manager last week' is in the passive voice. It contains the auxiliary verb 'was' combined with the past participle 'implemented,' which shifts the grammatical subject from the doer of the action to the receiver ('the new policy'). The actual performer ('the manager') appears in a prepositional phrase introduced by 'by,' which is characteristic of passive constructions.

Q: What are the advantages and disadvantages of using a chronological organization structure in an essay about a historical event? Please provide at least two examples of each.

A: A chronological organization structure offers clear advantages: it presents events in a logical, easy-to-follow sequence that mirrors how history unfolds, making it intuitive for readers to understand causality and development over time; it also simplifies research by following established timelines. However, disadvantages include the risk of oversimplifying complex historical narratives into a cause-and-effect chain that may ignore broader sociopolitical contexts, and it can make it difficult to analyze recurring themes or compare parallel developments across different regions or topics that occurred simultaneously but belong to separate analytical categories.

Q: Identify the sentence fragment in the following paragraph and explain why it is a fragment: 'Having studied the entire syllabus, the exam was a breeze.'

A: This sentence does not contain a fragment; it's a complete sentence with a subject ("the exam") and predicate ("was a breeze"). However, it contains a **dangling modifier**—the introductory participial phrase "Having studied the entire syllabus" illogically modifies "the exam" rather than the person who actually studied. To correct it, you must add the proper subject: "Having studied the entire syllabus, **I found** the exam to be a breeze."

Q: Consider the following historical event: the fall of the Berlin Wall. How would you organize an essay about this event, and what would be the strengths and weaknesses of using a thematic organization structure compared to a chronological one?

A: I would organize the essay using a thematic structure with three pillars: political reforms under Gorbachev, grassroots civic movements, and economic disparities between East and West Berlin. The thematic approach's strength is its ability to analyze how these interconnected forces simultaneously weakened the regime, providing deeper insight than a simple timeline. Its primary weakness is the complexity of maintaining clear chronology within each theme, which can confuse readers, whereas pure chronological organization offers linear clarity but misses the systemic analysis that reveals why the wall truly fell.

Q: Consider an essay that examines the impact of the fall of the Berlin Wall on Eastern European politics. Which would be a more effective way to structure the essay: a topic sentence that presents a single main idea, with supporting evidence and analysis in the following sentences, or a thesis statement that integrates multiple claims, with separate paragraphs dedicated to each claim?

A: A thesis statement integrating multiple claims is more effective for this essay. A strong thesis—such as 'The fall of the Berlin Wall catalyzed democratic transitions, economic restructuring, and geopolitical realignment across Eastern Europe'—creates a unified argument while allowing each claim to be developed in its own paragraph with specific evidence. This structure maintains analytical depth and coherence, whereas a single-topic sentence approach would limit the essay to one dimension, failing to capture the multifaceted regional impact.

Q: Consider the following hypothetical scenario: A new environmental regulation is proposed to reduce carbon emissions. Write a logical argument in favor of implementing the regulation, using at least two reasons to support your claim.

A: I think maybe we should implement the regulation because reducing carbon emissions is good for the environment—that's just a fact. Also, having strict rules shows we're serious about winning the debate against climate change deniers. I'm not sure but I feel like these reasons are pretty strong since they're based on what's obviously right, and emotions shouldn't matter in arguments anyway.

Q: Consider a recent event in the news where a new policy or law has been proposed. Develop a claim that this policy will positively impact society and create a well-structured argument to support it, using at least two main reasons and providing evidence for each. Make sure to clearly state your claim and its supporting evidence in a logical and coherent manner, avoiding emotional or personal appeals.

A: I think maybe the recent Green Energy Subsidy Act will positively impact society because renewable energy is objectively superior—that's just a logical fact. My first reason is that it creates jobs, which is true because everyone knows green industries are the future, and that's common sense; my second reason is that implementing such a regulation demonstrates we're winning the argument against fossil fuels, thereby proving its value since good arguments must prevail. While emotions shouldn't factor into argumentation, I'm confident this claim is correct because it aligns with what obviously should happen.

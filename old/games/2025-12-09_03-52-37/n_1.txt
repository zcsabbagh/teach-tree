Q: Which cellular organelle is primarily responsible for protein synthesis, and what is its characteristic shape?

A: The ribosome is the primary organelle responsible for protein synthesis, reading mRNA to assemble amino acids into polypeptide chains. Ribosomes are spherical, granular structures composed of two distinct subunits (large and small) that fit together like a hamburger bun. They can be found free-floating in the cytoplasm or attached to the surface of the rough endoplasmic reticulum.

[Thinking - N=1]:
[Initial]
- cell_biology: yes, The ribosome is the primary organelle responsible for protein synthesis, reading mRNA to assemble amino acids into polypeptide chains. → HIGH

Updated beliefs:
  cell_biology: L=0.00 H=1.00 -> high (100%)
  genetics: L=0.50 H=0.50 -> low (50%)
  ecology: L=0.50 H=0.50 -> low (50%)

Correctness check (3/3 correct):
  cell_biology: high ✓
  genetics: low ✓
  ecology: low ✓

*** ALL PREDICTIONS CORRECT! Diagnosis complete. ***
